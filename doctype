<!-- At the top of your document, you need to tell the browser which version of HTML your page is using.
You tell the browser this information by adding the <!DOCTYPE ...> tag on the first line, 
where the ... part is the version of HTML. For HTML5, you use <!DOCTYPE html>.
The html is not case sensitive.
the rest of your HTML code needs to be wrapped in html tags <html> </html>
your HTML code would go in the space between the two html tags
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<h1></h1>
</html>
